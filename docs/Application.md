# Application

QUsb2Snes alone is pretty useless, it comes with various application that you can found in the application menu. Magic2Snes is special application, the best way is to refer to [Magic2Snes](https://github.com/Skarsnik/Magic2snes/wiki/Users)

# Fileviewer (Legacy)

This application allows you access your SD2Snes files and perform some special operation, like starting a game, applying a patch.

This is one of the original application written by Redguyy, the Ui is not very fun, you can try your luck with QFile2Snes to have stuff like drag & drop.

The application will not work with something else than a sd2snes as files make no sense in other devices.

# MemoryView

This application allow you to have a look at various memory of your SNES and overwrite value if you want.

# InputViewer

This is patched [NintendoSpy](https://github.com/jaburns/NintendoSpy) that use some memory value of your device to display the buttons your press. It has some limitation like not showing input during screen transition and such.
