QtApp means the file is a Qt application that requieres the Qt DLLs to run
Since providing then for every application add ~10Mb of duplicate files
QUsb2Snes run the Qt Application directly from its own repository so
Windows can find the one used by QUsb2Snes and be able to run the application.
This remove the ability for the application to be started outside QUsb2Snes.

TLDR; You can't run the application outside QUsb2Snes application menu
