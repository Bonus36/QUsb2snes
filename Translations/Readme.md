## Prerequisites

You do not need to install the whole toolchains needed to build the project (Qt framework) to work on translations.

Just download [Qt-Linguist](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Home-Education/Qt-Linguist.shtml)
and follow the [linguist translators documentation](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html).

## Translation process

You will need to download the code source to get some context.
It is probably a better idea to download from the git master repository.
You can either clone the repository locally or [download the master archive](https://github.com/Skarsnik/QUsb2snes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
It is recommended to use the master/main branch, as it will be the most up-to-date branch.

## Testing translations

If you want to test your translation you will need to whole Qt toolkit to build and run the application.

## Committing the translations

The preferred way is to fork the repository on GitHub, create a branch and creating a pull request from the updated branch.

If you are not familiar with the git/GitHub PR process, you may also send me or one of the contributors
the translation files vie email. We will attach your name to the commit (in the author field, not the commit message)
to retain your contribution in the git history.
